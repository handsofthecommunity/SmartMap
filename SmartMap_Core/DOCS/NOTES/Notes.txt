Version 0.50 (Alpha)								--=SmartMap=--
																
																													
SmartMap is originally designed for use with the Axiom3D project and might be ported later to a C++ project depending
how well something like Boost Graph Library would convert.
Mainly this is an attempt to be Object Orientated and efficient using the QuickGraph library and other pathfinding libraries
and too create a useful automation/procedural device for hardware and software environments.
(an A.I SceneManeger relying heavily on QuickGraph which was inspired originally by the C++ Boost Graph Library).
It also uses the Wintillect.PowerCollections library for the MultiDictionary class.

(Installation)
This will compile with .NET 3.5 and above installed. Visual Studio 2008. The latest Managed DirectX SDK should be installed
for compiling. Basic DX update for the binary release.
- Unzip the SmartMap source code into your selected location on disk.
- If needed, redo references to the /SmartMap/Library/ dll files on your disk.
- If needed, link references in the EngineConfig.xml and Terrain.xml located in the Debug and Release folders.

UPGRADE INFO:
# This a a pure Alpha release. Most stuff intended for SmartMap final is working but it's buggy for now.
# Fully upgraded QuickGraph for .NET 3.5 using Generics
# Recognition of outer wall meshes. NearbyEdgesEmpty() can be set to recognize more meshes. Keep experimenting.
# A third Y height added to the Vertex struct and hence SmartMap is now fully 3D.
# FLOAT and INT32 are being used for Point and Vector structs to have a 2D and 3D element for the prime Generic for more accuracy and speed.
# Automated terrain deformation is now in using Set HeightAt(). Terrain is re-molded but not re-loaded through LoadWorldGeometry()
	as that makes it almost black. Needs to be fixed, even for planet to planet terrain changes. 
# Check the SmartMap thread on the Axion boards for SetHeightAt() code release. Should be implemented in next releases of Axiom Crickhollow later.

DONE:
# Y-Height aspect added for Vertex navigation.
# AI Pathfinding is in although a little buggy with the rotation and terrain navigation.
# Automated terrain deformation is now in!
# Updated to QuickGraph w/Generics (.NET 3.5)
# Outer and inner wall recognition plus more 
# Octree type terrain. Can be used for zoning as well.
# Complex GUI
# Random flat (X, Z) mesh creation in an organized way (a labyrinth using about 5-10 different meshes to create rooms and walls)
# Random structures wrap around terrain with added UI settings support.
# A paging 3D labyrinth creator that is infinite. (uses QuickGraph for maze creation).
# A complete basic 2D GDI+ based graphics engine. Used as a GUI right now for maze and location detection.

TODO:
# Automatic terrain deformation reload needs to be fixed. Molding could be better as triangles are too large in some areas to mold well.
# Mesh batching is in for the next Crickhollow release of SmartMap
# Add better 'minimalist' error handling
# Zones will be created from Octree Nodes.
# Add in XML support for saving and loading of maps.
# Only dynamically load in meshes that are dynamic as you move for Draw4D. This will include items and NPCs.
# Use CEGUI and Render To Texture for aspects of Draw2D.
# Add more media types in Draw4D to associate with types found in other open source projects.
