"The Dream Machine" is the creation of Mark Madsen ominysteriously known as "ioncycle." No Bitmaps are utilized in this program.
It is strictly based off of GDI+ Graphics Path.

TODO:
- Look at Paint.NET sourcecode to see how to splice a canonocial spline into 2 splines easily
This so the path can break apart easily creating multiple Splines for a fluid enviromnet.
- Have Spline bend where it hits and then break when it reaches a certain tension point according
to the malleability set for the graphics object.
