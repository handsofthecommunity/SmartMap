SMARTMAP TOOLS FOR AXIOM 3D [BLENDER https://www.blender.org/]
===========================
AXIOM STILL USES ALOT OF TOOLS FROM OGRE 3D
===========================================
Please use these tools as needed. They are especially useful with Blender.
Each have their own notes.
If you need to upgrade any of these tools please check the SmartMap Repo,
or you can find the updates online.

Install this open source 3D modeler to make your structures: https://www.blender.org/
Go ahead and create as many puzzle piece tiles as you can.
Blender will come with the Ogre .MESH importer preinstalled, but you need to install the exporter tool "blender2ogre."
Export your work as a Scene.
Then ugrade the XML mesh files with OgreXMLConverter.
You should then have a .mesh file and a .material file to use in Smartmap.
